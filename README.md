Urban Area Data Scraper
This repository contains a Python script to scrape, clean, and process data on the largest urban areas from Wikipedia. The script extracts relevant information, processes it into a structured format, and prepares it for analysis.

Overview
The script performs the following steps:

Fetches the Wikipedia page for the largest cities using the requests library.
Extracts the relevant table containing urban area data using BeautifulSoup.
Cleans and processes the data using pandas:
Flattens multi-index column headers.
Renames columns for consistency.
Converts numeric data to appropriate types.
Removes rows with missing or invalid numeric data.
Features
Data Source: Wikipedia - List of Largest Cities
Technologies Used: Python, requests, pandas, BeautifulSoup
Outputs a clean DataFrame with the following columns:
City.a.: Name of the city
Country: Name of the country
Population: Urban area population
Area.km2.: Urban area size in square kilometers
Density..km2.: Population density per square kilometer
How to Run
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas beautifulsoup4 requests
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python script_name.py
View the output: The script prints the cleaned DataFrame's first few rows to the console.

Example Output
yaml
Copy code
       City.a. Country  Population  Area.km2.  Density..km2.
0        Tokyo   Japan   37732000     8231.0         4584.0
1        Delhi   India   32226000     2344.0        13748.0
2     Shanghai   China   24073000     4333.0         5556.0
Notes
The script handles malformed or missing data gracefully by coercing invalid numeric data to NaN and optionally dropping such rows.
Adjust the URL or column names if the Wikipedia page structure changes.
